# Configuration of shortcuts for fish

Use bind to configure the shortcuts, e.g.,
`bind -M insert \ck 'accept-autosuggestion'`. `-M` is used to define the mode of
the shortcut. `accept-autosuggestion` is the input function, which means accept
the current autosuggestion. For more special function see
[this](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/bind.html).
