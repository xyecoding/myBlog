It is hard to use reveal.js when you want to draw something like flow chart.
There maybe two solutions for this.

1. Draw them use other tools and include the svg in the reveal.js.
2. Use the online editor of reveal.js. It provide full feature for PPT. You can
   design your ppt online and then download the html file. You can try to change
   the html e.g. include your markdown file.
