_Root in: I want to find out where the "kill shortcut", ctrl C, defined. I use
`bind -P` to check the shortcuts. However, do not find ctrl C. Thus, I learned
something about the shortcuts on linux. ctrl C is a shortcut of stty. However,
`bind -P` lists the shortcuts of readline._

There may be two kinds of shortcuts, in practice,

- stty shortcuts
- readline shortcuts

# stty (set tty, set teletypewriter)

The difference between shell, terminal and tty

tty: Print the file name of the terminal connected to standard input.

stty: change or print terminal characteristics, change and print terminal line
settings.

They are related to terminal.

- terminal = tty = text input/output environment
- console = physical terminal
- shell = command line interpreter

The input of terminal or tty will used by readline, but not always readline.

# gun readline - get a line from a user with editing

## Synopsis

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <readline/readline.h>
#include <readline/history.h>

char *
readline (const char *prompt)

```

## Description

**readline will read a line from the terminal and return it, using _prompt_ as a
prompt.**

If prompt is NULL or the empty string, no prompt is issued. The line returned is
allocated with `malloc`; the caller must free it when finished. The line
returned has the final newline removed, so only the text of the line remains.

## Return Value

readline returns the text of the line read. A black line returns the empty
string. If EOF is encountered while reading a line, and the line is empty, NULL
is returned. If an EOF is read with a non-empty line, it is treated as a
newline.

## Initialization file

Readline is customized by putting commands in an initialization file (the
`inputrc` file). The name of this file is taken from the value of the INPUTRC
environment variable. If that variable is unset, the default is `~/.inputrc`. If
that file does not exist or cannot be read, the ultimate default is
`/etc/inputrc`.

When a program which uses the readline library starts up, the init file is read,
and the key bindings and variables are set.

There are only a few basic constructs allowed in the readline init file.

1. Black lines are ignored.
2. Lines beginning with a `#` are comments.
3. Lines beginning with a `$` indicate conditional constructs.
4. Other lines denote key bindings and variable settings.

Each program using this library may add its own commands and bindings.

For example, placing

```bash
M-Control-u: universal-argment
```

into the `inputrc` would make `M-C-u` execute the readline command
`universal-argument`.

# The difference of `help` and `man` on linux

`help` displays information about builtin shell commands.

`man` is s system-wide documentation system that provides short reference
manuals for individual commands, API functions, concepts, configuration file
syntax, file formats. It is the traditional Unix documentation system.

We can get the information of `cd` by `help cd`, but not by `man cd`. We can get
the information of `git/nvim/stty` by `man git/nvim/stty`, but not by
`help git/nvim/stty`. `cd` is a shell command and `git/nvim/stty` is linux
projects.
